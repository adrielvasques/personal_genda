# Personal Agenda Management System

The aim of this work is to develop a system to manage and organize a personal agenda, including appointments.

## Description

The objective of your work is to develop a system to manage and organize a personal agenda, including appointments and tasks, following these recommendations:

- The system should allow its user to manage their personal information and plan their daily activities, including planning and controlling tasks and scheduling appointments.

-  Besides recording information, the application should support various types of queries (e.g., tasks to be completed daily, weekly, monthly) and alarms (e.g., dentist appointment at 3:00 PM).

- Tasks should have a status (planned, active, completed) and a completion date.

- Each task will belong to a category (e.g., personal, work, projects). The list of categories should be managed by the user.

## Minimum Functionalities

- Task management (registration, query, modification, and removal)
- Category management
- Viewing today's and future tasks
- Marking a task as completed
- Other functionalities that you find important
