## Description

InputToXLSX is a web application designed to simplify data handling. Built with the Streamlit framework, it allows users to enter data into a form, processes this data, and displays it in a clear, sortable table using AgGrid. The application offers the practical feature of exporting data directly to an Excel file (XLSX format), facilitating easy analysis and reporting.

The entered data pertains to BMI (Body Mass Index) calculations. The application provides a count for each BMI category based on the processed data, informing the user of the number of entries within each category. If a category has approximately 30 entries, the application will calculate the 75th percentile for that group. You can view the inputted data in an AgGrid table under the 'Dados Inseridos' tab, where you also have the option to delete an entry if necessary.
